# Maintaining ML Accuracy with 85% Fewer Features

Conducted an in-depth analysis of smartphone prices to identify the impact of various technical features on price classification using sophisticated data mining techniques. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve high accuracy in price predictions.

## Key Highlights:

- Maintained 91% accuracy while reducing the dimensionality by 85%, from 20 features to just 3
- Improved the model's ability to generalize across different datasets by simplifying the feature set.
- Identified key features affecting prices like RAM, battery power, and screen resolution
- Optimized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for price classification
- Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Compared model performance before and after feature extraction
- Performed feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
- Cleaned and transformed raw data for consistency
- Removed noise and irrelevant features
- Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for model development and analysis
